# What is the Anet A8

The Anet A8 is a low-cost 3D printer kit from China which clones the Prusa I3, an open source 3D printer.  Because of it's sales volume the kit can commonly be purchased for $180 USD or less.

# What is the Chimera Hotend

The Chimera hotend is a hot-end from E3D which supports the extrusion of two different types of plastic while using the same heatsink.  It reduces the overall size of the hotend compared to two separate hotends.
